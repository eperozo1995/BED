				<p> In 2020, as isolation became the norm and folks all over Brooklyn were sent home, a new group of Crown Heights organizers, inspired by the 1930s eviction blockades, began to scheme. It wasn’t until an illegal eviction took place on Dean Street, and said organizers came together in an intense direct confrontation with the police, the hired muscle of the landlords, and the landlord themself that those select few realized it was time to really do something, thus Brooklyn Eviction Defense (BED) was born. As the pandemic led to severe economic loss for Brooklynites, community members all over turned to mutual aid and self organized efforts in order to do what the capitalist state was failing to do, provide. While many self organized coalitions have dissolved over the years, BED, a fully volunteer run organization, continues on.
				</p>

				<p> BED has exhausted an extensive list of support efforts as they seek to address the multiple needs tenants have by data scraping, door knocking, radical direct action, and so forth. Recently, BED held a public housing defense at 964 Park Place which led to an influx of new organizers joining the organization. That housing defense required donation efforts, around the clock bodies and protection at 964 Park Place, political education, social media support, and much more. Through these efforts BED has been able to help form 24 tenant associations and three tenant councils and keep hundreds of tenants from being illegally evicted.  </p>

					<h3> Digital Organizing </h3>
					<div class="photo"> <img src="digital_2.png"> 
						<figcaption class="graphic-text">In 2021, while the eviction moratorium was in place, coding organizers developed a scraper which would comb through disparate court website data, housing court data, and aggregate it, pulling the names of tenants who were about to be evicted. This allowed the organization to more direct outreach to people in need.</figcaption>

						<figcaption class="graphic-text">Once the results from the scraper came through, other organizers would then create a map highlighting where those tenants lived, and then spend the weekend (often 4-6 hour shifts) door knocking, informing those tenants they were about to be evicted. Some tenants were aware, many were not.</figcaption>

					<h3> Housing Defense</h3> 
					<div class="photo"> <img src="house.svg"> 
						<figcaption class="graphic-text">One of BED’s primary efforts include radical direct action through housing defense. This means dozens, sometimes hundreds, of people spend days, even weeks, occupying an apartment or building in order to seize the unjust displacement of a tenant. </figcaption>

					<h3> Autonomous Power </h3>
					<div class="photo"> <img src="direct_action.png"> 
						<figcaption class="graphic-text">Through trial and error BED has made the collective decision to not discuss the size of its organization. One reason being the size number often ebbs and flows, but mainly because BED derives its power from intimidating landlords. For that reason, its important to keep those numbers private. </figcaption>
